# Food-Project
 
 The food project is a project based in NLP. It's one of the project I did in my training as data Scientist. 
 
 *Business case: There will be a foodie fair in your city next summer, and the organsers have contacted us because they are interested in performing an analysis of the world wide cuisines. They manage to obtain a dataset from different cuisines all over the world, together with the list of the most common ingredients. Some of our strongest geographic and cultural associations are tied to a region's local foods, so they are interested to know more information regarding them in order to organise the different stands. People from Marketing have ideas on how to plan the fair but they want to complement their ideas with some rough results.*
